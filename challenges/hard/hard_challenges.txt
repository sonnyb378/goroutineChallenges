Challenge 5: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
Write a Go program that multiplies two large matrices concurrently using goroutines. 
The program should efficiently distribute the work among multiple goroutines to speed 
up the computation.

Input:
Two matrices to be multiplied.

Desired Output:
The resulting product matrix.



Challenge 6: Concurrent Sudoku Solver

Create a Go program that solves Sudoku puzzles concurrently. 
The program should be able to take Sudoku boards of varying 
difficulty levels and use goroutines to attempt to solve them. 
The Sudoku puzzle should be represented as a 9x9 grid, with 
some cells filled, and the program should find the solution by
concurrently trying different possibilities.

Input:
A Sudoku puzzle board (9x9 grid) with some cells filled.

Desired Output:
The program should find and print the solved Sudoku board.
