Challenge 1: Simple Parallel Summation
Write a Go program that calculates the sum of all elements in a large array 
concurrently using goroutines.

Input:
data := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Desired Output:
Sum: 55


Challenge 2: Concurrent Factorial Calculator
Write a Go program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a 
separate goroutine for the calculation.

Input:
n := 5

Desired Output:
Factorial of 5 is 120
