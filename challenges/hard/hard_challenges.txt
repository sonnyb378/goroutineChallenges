Challenge 1: Distributed File Search
Create a Go program that searches for a specific keyword in a large directory 
of text files concurrently. Implement multiple worker goroutines to speed up 
the search process.

Input:
A directory with text files and a target keyword.

Desired Output:
A list of files where the keyword was found.

Challenge 2: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
Write a Go program that multiplies two large matrices concurrently using goroutines. 
The program should efficiently distribute the work among multiple goroutines to speed 
up the computation.

Input:
Two matrices to be multiplied.

Desired Output:
The resulting product matrix.
