	// Challenge: Bank Account Transactions with Mutex
	// Title: Simulate bank account transactions with Mutex.

	// Description: Create a Go program that simulates bank account transactions by multiple concurrent goroutines. Each goroutine represents a customer and can either deposit or withdraw a random amount of money from the account. Use a Mutex to protect the shared bank account data. Ensure that the account balance is updated correctly and does not go negative.

	// Input: Number of customers, initial account balance, and the number of transactions each customer should perform.

	// Desired Output: The final balance of the bank account after all transactions.

	// Correct Output:
	// Final Balance: $5325.50

	// Wrong Output:
	// Final Balance: $-126.75 (due to data races)
