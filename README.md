# Goroutine Project Challenges

This repository is a collection of challenges aimed at helping me understand Goroutines, Channels, WaitGroup, and Mutexes in GoLang. By working on these projects, I have gained practical experience and insight into concurrent programming in Go.

## Things I've Learned

During this project, I've gained valuable insights into concurrent programming in GoLang, including:

- How to create and manage Goroutines effectively.
- Using channels for inter-Goroutine communication.
- Synchronizing Goroutines using WaitGroups for orderly execution.
- Protecting shared resources with Mutexes to avoid data races.
- Understanding deadlock errors
